    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",

    "Increasing RM would be directly correlated to increasing value of house prices. A house that resides in a neighbourhood with a high average number of rooms would increases the statistical possibility that the house being considered has many rooms and thus an increased worth. Additionally houses situated in a high value areas will see increased prices purely by association of local geography in an expensive neighbourhood. \n",

    "Training the model against all the data could lead to overfitting. Without splitting the model may just memorise the entire data set, this would lead to high scores when evaluating model performance against training data, however the model may then begin to perform poorly when asked to predict a value that did not appear in the original dataset. This is indicative of a model not generalising well because it has become too specific, also known as an error through variance. This problem can be elevated by splitting the data into a set that is used for training and a set used for testing only. The model can see and learn from training data whereas the model must not learn from the testing data otherwise we may end up with overfitting, the testing data is used to evaluate performance of the model against data it has not been trained with, this should help us ensure the model generalises well. One consideration when splitting our data into a training/testing ratio is that if we do make our training set sufficiently large enough then the model will not be able fully learn the general trends of the underlying data, this could result in too simplistic a model and a cause of underfitting. This is also known as an error through bais. In summary splitting the dataset into separate training and testing sets allows us to develop models that can generalise well with the ability to evaluate performance metrics in relation to the testing set."

    "The training curve remains fixed at 1.0 throughout the increasing number of points. An R2 score of 1.0 suggests that the model can perfectly predict all the points from the training set. As more points are added this trend holds and the model seems invariant to the number of points added, I would suggest if more points were added to the training set the model would still return a very high R2 score. The testing score for the model starts off low, this is to be expected because the model could not be trained very accurately with a small number of points. The trend of the curve suggests the accuracy of the model improves with more points until it reaches about 150 points. At this point the testing curve appears to plateau and subsequently adding more points does not yield an improvement in accuracy of testing data. This pattern draws two lines that are not appearing to converge despite more points being added to the training and testing sets. This particular model seems to exhibit signs of overfitting, the model appears to memorise the training set, hence the high R2 scores and then subsequently fails to generalise well for the testing data, this is the cause of the gap between the learning curves that would diminish with a better model. Due to the overfitting nature I would not expect more points to benefit the model. \n",

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The model trained with ‘max_depth=1’ suffers from high bias. Initially adding more training points improves the score of testing score, although at the detriment to the training score. As more points are added training score continues to degrade, while the testing score does improve slightly it eventually plateaus and the two curves begin to converge at around 0.5. The converged score indicates the model isn’t that accurate, this expected from a model which makes many errors, caused in this case by underfitting. The lack of improvement in testing coupled with worsening accuracy of training indicates the model maybe too simplistic and thus suffers from high bais. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the model trained with ‘max_depth = 10’ exhibits signs of overfitting and thus suffers from high variance. The perfect R2 training score indicates the model is memorising the training data set, which causes issues when attempting to generalise and predict results based on the testing data. The large gap between training and testing curves is a sign of overfitting and illustrates that adding further points probably won’t improve the model. A better performing model would converge the training and testing curves. \n"

    "I believe that the model trained with maximum depth = 4 would best generalise to unseen data. This correlates well to the maximum depth results show in question 5. A small max depth parameter of 1 yields an underfitted model while 10 creates an overfitted model, therefore we can assume the a model that generalises well sits between this range. The complexity curve generated from training and validation sets suggests the optimal configuration is 4 which has the highest validation score for a fairly accurate training score. Selecting a max depth which yields a higher training score could begin to overfit the model due to increased complexity. While reducing the max depth to 3 creates lower accuracy score. Therefore I think 4 is the optimal hyper parameter for this case. \n"

The technique then trains various models using the requested hyper parameter configurations, the performance of each model will be evaluated against the validation set.

    "The selection of well performing model should not be based on the test data set as you would then be intentionally choosing a model that you know will perform accurately on the testing set, however in doing this knowledge about the testing set has formed part of your decision on the best method to train your model. This may lead to model that overfits which will not generalise well when presented with unseen data not in the testing set. The sklearn KFold documentation cites this problem “knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance”. The solution, use a validation set to assess the performance models that has not been used for training and is independent from the testing set, so as not to corrupt the result. This process requires us to partition the training data into two chunks, one to train and one to validate. In order to maximise the data available to us that can train models we use the k-fold cross-validation technique. This requires us to split the training and validation set into k buckets of data, where k is nominal value that denotes the size of each bucket. Given a combined training and validation set of size 30 with k=6 we would create 6 chunks that each contain 5 data points. In this example the model is then trained 6 times, each time one chunk of 5 data points is separated to evaluate the performance of model and the other k-1 buckets used to train the model. The performance of each model is then averaged over the combinations of k buckets that have been generated. This. As referred to in the docs this technique maybe computationally expensive because we train and evaluate many models with possibly many combinations of training/validation data, however it ensures we use maximises the amount of data used to train and validate model performance without resorting to testing data to inform decisions about model training. With respect to the Grid Search technique, k-fold cross-validation would maximise the amount of data available to train models. This would allow us to select the most performant model from the matrix of hyperparameter configurations while ensuring the best estimated model hasn’t been corrupted with knowledge of performance on the testing data. The final step would be to run the trained model against the test set and ensure we maintained a good level of performance compared to our training/validation sets. It’s worth noting that running k-fold validation on each cell of the grid search matrix could generate a large number of models and could become quite computationally expensive. "

    "The data collected from 1978 could still be useful given a set of caveats. Provided the data has been properly scaled for inflation as stated in the introduction to this project the monetary worth should be equivalent to value today. However if the housing market has become more/less competitive since 1978 then the trends we would see today maybe massively different to that of the historic dataset. If there is proportionally less housing available in today’s market than there were 1978 then it could unevenly drive up house prices particularly at the bottom end of the market. With this in mind the data should be treated as not wholly comparable with data produced more recently, but it still provides a set of data points in the Boston housing market so it would be irresponsible to fully discount it.\n",
    "\n",

    "In reality the model is probably too simplistic, more variables within the dataset would be required to fully capture the response of price per house. Amenities (e.g hotub, swimming pool), square feet of land and projected future development in the local area would all hugely impact the potential worth of a property. Given this information I would expect the model to underfit as it likely does not fully model the relationship of price from the 3 distinct properties we are currently analysing. As previously discussed the model appears to struggle with estimating data that we would expect to sit at the edges of low/high prices. Additionally the range of values produced in the sensitivity trails would indicate the model is not that stable. From the mean value of prices produced in the predicted trails \\$404,474.47, the range of \\$69,044.61 equates to 17% of the total value, this amount of variation in prices is too large to be considered an accurate stable predication.  \n",

    "Attempting to repurpose the model to predict house prices for that in rural area when it has been trained against urban data would most likely result in predications that are very inaccurate. There are many factors such as increased property worth in a city location, far greater square feet of land for a given price of a house in a rural environment that would distort our modelled predictions. One concrete example for the model we have trained would be the ratio of students to teachers in rural areas would be far lower due to the spread out geography of properties, although this would likely have less of an effect on house price when compared to an urban environment. Using the Boston dataset to train a model that will estimate prices in a completely different type of environment would likely lead to a drop in model accuracy and is probably not that applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "I do not think it would be valid to calculate an individual house price from information only pertaining to the general neighbourhood. To provide a truly accurate prediction for a particular house, its attributes must be considered on a case by case basis. A concrete example would be a property with a small number of rooms in an expensive neighbourhood, while price would certainly be influenced from the expensive houses in the vicinity, a lack of desirable features would inevitably lower it's worth and this may be missed by our model if it is only concerned with the majority of houses in the area that have many more rooms. However the model could be useful if used in a particular capacity, generation of an initial rough price prediction in the local area, from this an estate agent could apply their expertise in order to generate a more precision estimation per property basis.\n",

In order to improve the model I believe it should be trained on a more recent dataset with an increased number of variables that would help to better model the response of price to a given set of features. Trained against neighbourhood characteristics only the model could provide some insight for an estate agent to give them a rough guide price but it would still require their expertise to produce an accurate estimate. Training the model to estimate price for a given house instead of neighbour could require a significantly more complex approach in order to effectively model the data. \n",
